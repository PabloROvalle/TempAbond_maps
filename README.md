# TempAbond_maps


These codes allows us to use the outputs from the inversion method, the .inv files, to show the results of simulataneous inversions (150 in this case). THEY ARE NOT OPTIMISED and several changes have to be done if someone wants to use them.
Create_maps is able to plot  polar maps with the same geometry from the observations, and latlon is able to do lat vs pressure temperature maps, but you will have to create several repositories to store the different .inv files in them.
